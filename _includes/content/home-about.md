# About Malte Berneaud-KÃ¶tz
I'm a soon-to-graduate student of public policy who's found his passion in data analysis and programming.

At the moment, I am working as a research assistant at the Governance Report of the Hertie School. There I have the opportunity to live out my thirst for knowledge while contributing to an interesting research project on cultural diplomacy.

I'm intrigued by the sheer limitless possibilities of integrating data analysis with public policy problems to create solutions to everyday problems or analysing the impact of policies. The sheer boundless methods to learn in the realm of statistics and programming motivate me to improve with each passing day.

When I am not wrangling with data, I love everything cuisine. Much like dealing with data, it is one part science and one part art, a fusion which makes it so captivating. I am a lover of the sea, the seaside and battling the elements sailing. Also, sailing is the best way to get off-grid for me.

# Side Projects I'm working on

* ### [DataAnimals](http://www.data-animals.eu)
    * The DataAnimals are a group of students at Hertie School of Governance who dedicate themselves to providing data analysis, coaching and statistics workshops to non-profit NGO's free of charge
    * The goal is to raise awareness for the potential which rests in the data NGOs routinely collect about their activities and help NGOs with limited finacial capabilities to make use of data which has already been accumulated  

    * **Last DataAnimals project**: We participated in the [Datafest 2016](www.datafest.de), where our team received honourable mentions in two categories, but unfortunately no prices
